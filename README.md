## Notes

This website was fun to work on and a great learning experience. I hadn't used some of these languages in a little while so this project helped refresh my
memory. I had to spend some extra time on certain sections where I learned features in Javascript that I wasn't previously familiar with, but I didn't have any
major difficulties completing this project.
